The goal of redacted is to more easily redact sensitive data in strings. The  package provides a set of utility functions for masking sensitive information in text data. This includes functions for redacting credit card numbers, phone numbers, and other sensitive information using regular expressions, as well as a utility function for general masking.

## Installation

You can install the development version of redacted from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("parmsam/redacted")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(redacted)

## basic example code
text <- "My IP address is 192.168.0.1. Please don't share it with anyone."
redacted_text <- redact_ip_addresses(text)
cat(redacted_text)

text <- "Hello, my email address is john.doe@gmail.com. Please don't share it with anyone."
redacted_text <- redact_email_addresses(text)
cat(redacted_text)
```
